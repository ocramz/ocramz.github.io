The generalized minimal-residual method (GMRES) was introduced by Saad and Schultz in 1986 and to this day it is one of the more popular iterative algorithms for solving large linear systems; it is very versatile (works on general, i.e. non-Hermitian systems) and has a relatively simple derivation, which I will try to convey in simple terms in this post.

At each iteration, GMRES provides an increasingly more accurate approximation to the solution of a linear system $$A x = b$$, in the sense of the $$L_2$$ norm:

$$
\tilde{x} = \underset{x}{\arg \min} \| A x - b \|_2,
$$

where $$A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$$ is (assumed to be) of full rank (i.e. invertible), $$x \in \mathbb{C}^m$$ and $$b \in \mathbb{C}^m$$.

The approximate solution is sought in spaces of increasing dimensionality; in other words, at iteration $$i \in {1 .. m}$$ the solution $$\tilde{x}_i$$ will be a vector in $$\mathbb{C}^i$$.

This means that we need a series of projection matrices that map $$\mathbb{R}^i$$ to $$\mathbb{R}^m$$; the [Arnoldi process]() does precisely this
