The generalized minimal-residual method (GMRES) was introduced by Saad and Schultz in 1986 and to this day it is one of the more popular iterative algorithms for solving large linear systems; it is very versatile (works on general, i.e. non-Hermitian systems) and has a relatively simple derivation, which I will try to convey in simple terms in this post.
In the following, I will restrict the notation to the special case in which all vectors have real components, because the complex-valued case just involves exchanging $$\mathbb{R}$$ with $$\mathbb{C}$$.

At each iteration, GMRES provides an increasingly more accurate approximation to the solution of a linear system $$A x = b$$, in the sense of the $$L_2$$ norm (i.e. a "minimal-residual" solution):

$$
\tilde{x} = \underset{x}{\arg \min} \| A x - b \|_2,
$$

where $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$ is (assumed to be) of full rank (i.e. invertible), $$x \in \mathbb{R}^m$$ and $$b \in \mathbb{R}^m$$.

The approximate solution is sought in spaces of increasing dimensionality; in other words, at iteration $$i \in {1 .. m}$$ the solution $$\tilde{x}_i$$ will be a vector in $$\mathbb{R}^i$$.

This means that we need a series of vector bases ("Krylov subspaces") that map from $$\mathbb{R}^i$$ to $$\mathbb{R}^m$$; the [Arnoldi process](https://ocramz.github.io/mathematics/tutorials/2016/11/09/arnoldi-alt.html) provides these as by-products.

At iteration $$i$$, the Krylov subspace approximation to a vector in $$\mathbb{R}^m$$ can be written as $$x = Q_i y$$, in which the $$Q$$ matrices satisfy the Arnoldi recursion $$A Q_i = Q_{i+1} H_i$$. Recall that $$Q_i$$ is shorthand for a set of $$i$$ orthonormal vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^m$$ (i.e. that appear as the matrix columns).

We can now plug in the Krylov approximation and the Arnoldi identity into the residual equation to re-formulate the minimal residual problem:

$$
\|A x - b\| = \|A Q_i y - b\| = \|Q_{i+1} H_i y -b\|
$$
