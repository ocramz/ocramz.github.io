The generalized minimal-residual method (GMRES) was introduced by Saad and Schultz in 1986 and to this day is one of the most popular iterative algorithms for solving large linear systems; it is very versatile (works on general, i.e. non-Hermitian systems) and has a relatively simple derivation, which I will try to explain in simple terms in this post.

At each iteration, GMRES provides an increasingly more accurate approximation to the solution of a linear system $$A x = b$$, in the sense of the $$L_2$$ norm:
