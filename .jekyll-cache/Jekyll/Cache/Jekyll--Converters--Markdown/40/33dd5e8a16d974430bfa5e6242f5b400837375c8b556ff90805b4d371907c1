I"'<p>The generalized minimal-residual method (GMRES) was introduced by Saad and Schultz in 1986 and to this day it is one of the more popular iterative algorithms for solving large linear systems; it is very versatile (works on general, i.e. non-Hermitian systems) and has a relatively simple derivation, which I will try to convey in this post.
In the following, I will restrict the notation to the special case in which all vectors have real components, because the complex-valued case just involves exchanging \(\mathbb{R}\) with \(\mathbb{C}\).</p>
