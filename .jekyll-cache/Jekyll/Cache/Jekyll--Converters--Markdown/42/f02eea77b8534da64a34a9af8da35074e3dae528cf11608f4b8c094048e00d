<p>Interactive web applications feature a complex exchange of information between user, frontend and backend; in time the focus of this complexity has shifted from the backend (remember CGI scripts?) to the frontend (javascript, perhaps webassembly one day) and back.</p>

<p>Form-based interaction is an interesting subset of this problem since the input data is well structured and the problem can be formalized somewhat generally.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s a web form? Itâ€™s really two things : an (HTML) view and a callback that will process the inputs submitted via that view, and possibly produce a new view as a result.</p>

<p>Schematically, (v, x -&gt; Maybe v)</p>

<p>We would like this notion to be <em>composable</em> : forms are arrays of typed inputs (e.g. strings, booleans, numbers, dates), and we expect to parse the input into a corresponding arrays of output values.</p>

  <span class="kt">Pure</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Form</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<p>One such formalization is due to Cooper et al.</p>
