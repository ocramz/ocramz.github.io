<p>Building software in the open has been a lot of fun for a few years and it taught me a lot about collaboration and high-quality code bases.
    Here are some projects I'm particularly fond of:

    <p>Heidi (Haskell + tidy) is an experiment in dataframe UX for a strictly-typed functional language. 
        It uses generic programming to turn values from algebraic datatypes into row types (implementing half of an in-memory ORM, so to speak).

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="https://github.com/ocramz/sparse-linear-algebra">
      <h4 class="text-center">sparse-linear-algebra</h4>
      <p class="text-center"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ocramz/sparse-linear-algebra"/></p>
    </a>
    <p>A very ambitions sparse linalg library, providing linear solvers, factorizations (LU, QR) and eigensolvers. It was very instructive to try my hand at this, and 
        I'm grateful for the early adopters and contributors, but getting this right+performant is a huge task that should be delegated to more established libraries.
