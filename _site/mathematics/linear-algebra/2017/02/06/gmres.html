    <h1 class="post-title">The generalized minimal-residual method for linear systems</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Feb 6, 2017</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The generalized minimal-residual method (GMRES) was introduced by Saad and Schultz in 1986 and to this day it is one of the more popular iterative algorithms for solving large linear systems; it is very versatile (works on general, i.e. non-Hermitian systems) and has a relatively simple derivation, which I will try to convey in this post.
In the following, I will restrict the notation to the special case in which all vectors have real components, because the complex-valued case just involves exchanging <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script> with <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}</script>.</p>

<p>At each iteration, GMRES provides an increasingly more accurate approximation <script type="math/tex">\tilde{x}</script> to the solution of a linear system <script type="math/tex">A x = b</script>, in the sense of the <script type="math/tex">L_2</script> norm (i.e. a “minimal-residual” solution):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tilde{x} = \underset{x}{\arg \min} \| A x - b \|,</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}</script> is (assumed to be) of full rank (i.e. invertible), <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathbb{R}^n</script> and <script type="math/tex">b \in \mathbb{R}^m</script>.</p>

<p>The approximate solution is sought in spaces of increasing dimensionality; in other words, at iteration <script type="math/tex">i \in {1 .. m}</script> the solution <script type="math/tex">\tilde{x}_i</script> will be a vector in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^i</script>.</p>

<p>This means that we need a series of vector bases (“Krylov subspaces”) that map from <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^i</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^m</script>; the <a href="https://ocramz.github.io/mathematics/tutorials/2016/11/09/arnoldi-alt.html">Arnoldi process</a> provides these as by-products.</p>

<p>At iteration <script type="math/tex">i</script>, the Krylov subspace approximation to a vector in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^m</script> can be written as <script type="math/tex">x = Q_i y</script>, in which the <script type="math/tex">Q</script> matrices satisfy the Arnoldi recursion <script type="math/tex">A Q_i = Q_{i+1} H_i</script>. Recall that <script type="math/tex">Q_i</script> is shorthand for a set of <script type="math/tex">i</script> orthonormal vectors in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^m</script> (i.e. that appear as the matrix columns).</p>

<p>We can now plug in the Krylov approximation and the Arnoldi identity into the residual equation to re-formulate the minimal residual problem:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|A x - b\| = \|A Q_i y - b\| = \|Q_{i+1} H_i y -b\|</script>

<p>Since the columns of the <script type="math/tex">Q_i</script> matrices are orthogonal, if <script type="math/tex">Q_i v = w</script> then <script type="math/tex">v = Q_i^\dagger w</script>; this lets us rewrite the residual as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|H_i y - Q_{i+1}^\dagger b\|</script>

<p>We notice that <script type="math/tex">Q_{i+1}^\dagger b</script> rotates back the <script type="math/tex">b</script> vector to the canonical basis, which can be written as <script type="math/tex">\|b\| e_1 =: b_0</script>.</p>

<p>At this point we focus on the Hessenberg matrix <script type="math/tex">H_i</script> (specifically this is an upper-Hessenberg matrix, because all the elements <em>below</em> the first sub-diagonal are identically zero). This is convenient from a computational point of view, as we will see shortly.</p>

<p>Let us denote the QR factorization of <script type="math/tex">H_i</script> as <script type="math/tex">O_i U_i</script> (where <script type="math/tex">O_i</script> is orthonormal and <script type="math/tex">U_i</script> is upper triangular). Since the QR factorization operates on the sub-diagonal nonzero elements of its input matrix, applying it to a Hessenberg matrix means that only at most <script type="math/tex">i-2</script> rotations will be required in order to produce its answer.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to write the GMRES problem in its final form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\|A x - b\| = \left\|U_i y - O_i^\dagger b_0 \right\| \underset{y}{\rightarrow} min</script>

<p>which can be efficiently solved by back-substitution since <script type="math/tex">U_i</script> is upper triangular.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-some-optimizations">Conclusions and some optimizations</h2>

<p>To recap, at step <script type="math/tex">i</script> the GMRES algorithm requires:</p>

<p>1) applying the Arnoldi process to obtain a Krylov base for <script type="math/tex">\{A, b\}</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^i</script>,</p>

<p>2) factorizing the Hessenberg matrix obtained at step 1) in its QR factors,</p>

<p>3) solving for the minimal-residual vector <script type="math/tex">y</script> using a triangular solver (i.e. back-substitution),</p>

<p>4) retrieving the full-space solution using the Krylov relation <script type="math/tex">\tilde{x} = Q_i y</script>.</p>

<p>The version of GMRES I have implemented in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sparse-linear-algebra">sparse-linear-algebra</a> does not carry out steps 1-4 repeatedly, but simply finds the “largest” Krylov subspace (i.e. carries out Arnoldi until it breaks down, that is, until the norm of the <script type="math/tex">i</script>th orthogonal vector is found to be almost 0) and then proceeds with steps 2-4. I found this simpler solution to work quite well in practice.</p>

<p>A popular optimization is to interleave the Arnoldi process with the QR factorization; in particular, the first <script type="math/tex">i</script> columns of <script type="math/tex">H_{i+1}</script> are exactly <script type="math/tex">H_i</script>, so computing the QR factorization of <script type="math/tex">H_{i+1}</script> only requires applying one additional Givens’ rotation, and can recycle the QR factors of <script type="math/tex">H_i</script> (appropriately padded).</p>
